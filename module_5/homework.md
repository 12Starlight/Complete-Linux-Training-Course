# **Module 5 Homework**

### **Note:** 

<p>

Finally after using many online resources including [StackExchange](https://superuser.com/questions/1313692/how-to-setup-a-bridge-connection-for-enp0s3-centos7-on-oracle-virtualbox) and rewriting the <kbd>ifcfg-enp0s3</kbd> and <kbd>ifcfg-enp0s8</kbd> files for Bridged Network I resolved the problem. Using [Technology/Notes](https://sites.google.com/site/technologyslashnotes/home/linux/configure-networks-centos7-on-virtualbox),  I was able to find out that Virtualbox `DOES NOT` support WIFI connections using Bridge Adapter. 

This link explains it all. [Virtualbox Complaint Ticket](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10019). I did learn a lot about /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts.

After deducing that Virtualbox was not going to offer a solution, I went ahead and downloaded a free user key for VMWare Fusion and was able to ssh into my mac terminal! Success ðŸ”¥ðŸ˜Ž
